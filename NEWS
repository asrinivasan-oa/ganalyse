# v0.1

## Features

1. `rnaseq()` function loads sample info for a particular experiment. It 
returns a `fpkm` or `raw` object.

2. `gather_counts()` collects counts for all samples and returns `fpkm_counts` 
or `raw_counts` object respectively.

3. `show_counts()` is a useful function to inspect the loaded read counts.

4. `construct_design()` and `construct_contrasts()` allow construction of 
design matrix and various contrasts.

5. `limma_dge()` and `edger_dge()` methods allow performing DE analysis by 
providing `fpkm_counts` or `raw_counts` along with a design matrix and 
contrast.

6. `volcano_plot()` allows plotting of volcano plots from `dge` objects which 
are returned by `edger_dge()` and `limma_dge()` methods.

7. `write_dge()` is a simple wrapper to write `dge` objects to a `tsv` file.
